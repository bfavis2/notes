# Preface
Pragmatic Programmers are:
* Early adopters/Fast adapters - have an instinct for technologies and techniques
* Inquisitive - be a pack rat for little facts and tidbits
* Critical Thinkers - Doesn't accept things as given without the facts
* Realistic - Understand the underlying nature of each problem you face
* Jack of All Trades - Be familiar with a broad set of technologies and environments. Tech is constantly changing

Care about your craft and think about your work - Never run on autopilot and constantly learn.

Getting better is a continuous progress - need to water every day little by little to get somewhere.

# Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy

## Responsibility and Ownership

It is your life. You own it. If you don't like it then change. Don't be tied down to external factors. Be proactive and take opportunities.

Take responsibility and build trust. When something goes wrong, don't provide lame excuses or blame others. Provide options on how to fix it.

Follow up "I don't know" with "--but I'll find out later".

##

Don't leave bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code, etc. in your projects. It invites more software rot/technical debt.

Fix problems before they get out of hand and try to do things right the first time by thinking about future problems.

Be a catalyst for change - develop the backbone of project well. Show people and have them want to work on it on their own accord.

Develop "good-enough" software - keep an eye out for the big picture. Don't get distracted by too many bells and whistles.

Make quality a requirements issue - ask users how good they want the software to be.

Know when to stop - don't spoil a perfectly good program with overembellishment and overrefinement. Move on and let your code stand on its own for awhile.

It's never going to be "perfect" and that's ok.

## Knowledge Portfolio

Knowledge is an expiring asset - new technologies, tools, and techniques are constantly popping up.

Treat your knowledge as a portfolio:
* Invest regularly - Get in the habit of learning new things everyday.
* Diversify - The more different things you know, the better you can adjust to change and the thus the more valuable you are.
* Manage risk - Don't put all your eggs in one basket with high reward/high risk ventures. Also, don't just put all the eggs in a conservitave basket and
miss opportunities. Have both.
* Buy low, Sell high - Become an early adopter. Keep an out for potential technologies with room to grow.
* Review and Rebalance - Keep a level of polish on your knowledge. Go back to things you learned a long time ago and keep it up to date.

Ideas to keep invest in your knowledge portfolio:
* Learn a new language once a year
* Read a technical book each month
* Read non-technical books, too
* Take classes
* Participate in local user groups and meetups
* Experiment with different environments
* Stay current

Admit to not knowing something at take it as a challenge to find out more.

Develop critical thinking skills:
* Always ask why to get to the root of the problem
* Who does this benefit?
* What's the context?
* When/Where would this work?
* Why is this a problem?

## Communicate!

The greatest program/software/code is useless unless you can communicate with other people.

Treat English like another programming language.

Know your audience - tailor what you present to what your audience finds important. Stylize according to who you are talking to.

Know what you want say - prepare by writing an outline

Choose an appropiate moment to talk to someone.

Make your ideas look good - Don't just focus on the content and expect people to see what you see.

Actively engange with your audience - have them be part of the process.

Be an active listener. If you listen to people, people will listen to you. Learn from other people.

Get back to people - Respond to people as soon as you can and let them know if you can't fulfill their request right now.

Document everything! Treat documentation as part of the code instead of an afterthought.
